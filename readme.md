# Coagmento #

This is the next version of Coagmento, which is under active development.

Coagmento is split into four main services.

- **Coagmento Core** consists of the main Coagmento application and API. [Installation](core/readme.md)
- **Coagmento Realtime** enables realtime data updates and chat. [Installation](realtime/readme.md)
- **Coagmento Thumbnails** generates web page thumbnails. [Installation](thunbnail/readme.md)
- **Coagmento Docs** allows collaborative document editing (using Etherpad). [Installation]()

Coagmento Core is standalone and can be run without any of the other services. Each can be deployed on a separate server.
