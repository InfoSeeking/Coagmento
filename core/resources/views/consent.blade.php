                    <p>You are invited to participate in a research study that is being conducted by Dr. Chirag Shah,
                        who is an associate professor in the School of Communication and Information (SC&I) at Rutgers
                        University. The specific purpose of the study is to identify the problems and obstacles users
                        usually encounter when searching for information as well as the possible helps for tackling
                        these problems.</p>


                    <p>
                        This research is confidential. Confidential means that the research records will include some
                        information about you and this information will be stored in such a manner that some linkage
                        between your identity and the response in the research exists, during some period of the research.
                        However, there will be no linkage between your identity and your responses (i.e., web search logs,
                        answers to the questionnaires, interview recordings) at the conclusion of your participation in
                        the research. If you agree to take part in the study, you will be assigned a code number that
                        will be used on each search log and annotation record. Your name will appear only on a list of
                        subjects, which will be linked to the code number that is assigned to you only for the duration
                        of your participation in the study. Please note that this study is completely confidential.
                        <strong>At the end of your participation, the file that links your name and contact information
                            to your code number will be destroyed and will not be stored in any dataset or any form.</strong>
                        There will thus be no way to link your responses back to you.
                    </p>


                    <p>The research team and the Institutional Review Board at Rutgers University are the only parties
                        that will be allowed to see the data, except as may be required by law, or if you have agreed
                        to release the anonymized data for research purposes. If a report of this study is published,
                        or the results are presented at a professional conference, only group results will be stated.</p>


                    <p>This study aims to recruit 40 participants. The total amount of time needed for participating is
                        about one hour. There are no foreseeable risks to participation in this study. Although you may
                        receive no direct benefit from taking part in this study, other than payment for participation,
                        your participation will help in assisting the researchers to understand people’s information
                        seeking behavior, and therefore to improve information retrieval systems. If you are interested
                        in receiving the published results of our study you may contact the researchers listed below.</p>

                    <p>Participation in this study is voluntary. You may choose not to participate, and you may withdraw
                        at any time during the study procedures without any penalty to you. For participating in the
                        study, you will receive $95.00 in cash. If you decide to end participation before completing
                        he study, you will receive payment pro-rated for the amount of time that you have devoted to
                        the study. In addition, you may choose not to answer any questions with which you are not
                        comfortable. You should be aware that the researchers may continue to use and disclose data,
                        including your information that was provided before you withdrew your authorization, if necessary
                        to maintain integrity of the research or if the data had already been stripped of all identifiers.
                        If you wish to withdraw your permission for the research use or disclosure of your data and/or
                        health information in this study, you may do so in writing by contacting Dr. Chirag Shah.</p>

Also, if there are any questions you would rather not answer or that you do not feel comfortable answering, please say so and we will stop the interview or move on to the next question, whichever you prefer.</p>
